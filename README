Utilities for manipulating beans in a Spring Context:  
  - Collecting, filtering, and removing beans
  - Registering all beans of a given type (with filtering)
  - Preserving the type of a CGLIB/AOP-enhanced bean, to allow injection based on class instead of interface
  - Configuring java.util.Logger
